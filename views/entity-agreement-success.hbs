<p>Thanks for submitting the participant agreement as an entity. Here is the data we have recorded for you:

<h3>Public Data</h3>

<pre>{{publicData}}</pre>

<p>This public data is accessible in the <a href="https://github.com/{{publicDataRepo}}">{{publicDataRepo}}</a> GitHub repository, and will allow Editors to verify that GitHub users associated with your entity can contribute to the specified workstreams.

<p>If you need to edit this public data in the future, please submit a pull request (from a GitHub account authorized to make contributions on behalf of {{entityName}}) to <a href="https://github.com/{{publicDataRepo}}">{{publicDataRepo}}</a>.

<p>Note that for now your submission is marked as unverified. The first time a contributor associated with {{entityName}} submits a pull request to a standard, the editor will be responsible for verifying that your submission is accurate and representative. After that, future pull requests to the workstreams you chose to participate in will be automatically marked as approved.

<h3>Contributor Management</h3>

<p>Contributions from GitHub users which are publicly associated with the <a href="https://github.com/{{organizationName}}">{{organizationName}} GitHub organization</a> will be able to contribute on behalf of {{entityName}}.

<p>Note that contributors will need to publicly display their affiliation with the {{organizationName}} organization. For more information on how to do this, see the GitHub help article, "<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership/">Publicizing or hiding organization membership</a>".

<h3>Notifications</h3>

<p>Notifications of WHATWG policy changes and of any <a href="https://whatwg.org/workstream-policy#review-draft">Review Draft</a> publications will be through GitHub issues and pull requests, which you can subscribe to by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/">watching</a> appropriate repositories.

<p>To be notified of upcoming changes to WHATWG Policies, watch the <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/sg">whatwg/sg</a> repository; this is where WHATWG policies are maintained.

<p>To be notified when a Review Draft is published, watch the workstream repository for that Living Standard.

<p>Watching these repositories will generate many notifications related to ongoing WHATWG governance and standardization work, but you can filter using the subject-line prefixes "Policy Change:" or "Review Draft Publication:" if those specific events are all you are interested in.

<p>If you do not watch these repositories, you might miss important notifications that affect participation in the WHATWG. The notices generated by the repository are the only notices that the WHATWG will regularly provide regarding issues and pull requests (including changes to WHATWG policies and the posting of Review Drafts).

<p>Be sure to encourage anyone relevant in your organization, including the primary contact{{#if contact2}} and the secondary contact{{/if}}, to watch these repositories.
